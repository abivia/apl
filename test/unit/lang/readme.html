<h1>Notes on unit tests for PHP_LexerGenerator</h1>
<p>by Alan Langford &lt;jal@ambitonline.com&gt;</p>
<p>
AllTests.php runs the full suite of tests using PHPUnit from phpunit.de.
</p><p>
The current test cases are:
</p>


<h2>LexerTest</h2>
<p>These tests compare the token stream from a PHP_LexerGenerator_Lexer object with a 
known baseline. The intent of these tests is to thoroughly exercise specific code points 
within the parser.
</p>
<p>The lexerBaselineGenerator.php script can be used to create a new baseline when required.
Usage is:
</p>
<code>php lexerBaselineGenrator plexfile baselinefile</code>
<p>The baseline file is generated from the input plex file. The baseline is a text file 
that contains a JSON encoded version of the lexer token stream and some other lexer 
state data.
</p>


<h2>LexerGeneratorTest</h2>
<p>These tests exercise both the internal lexer and parser, either through comparison 
of the generated PHP file with expected output, or by executing phpt style tests. 
Data required to support the tests is stored in the data subdirectory. The .plex files 
are the files being tested; the .expect.php files are the expected outputs, the .php 
files are the actual output, and if there is a difference between actual and expected, 
a .diff file will be present to highlight the discrepancies.
</p>
<h3>Bug Reports</h3>
<p>Two types of bug report are handled. Bugs with a .plex file have a corresponding PHP 
created, and the output is compared to the .php file in the tests directory. If a 
difference is found then the generated PHP file is left in the data directory, and a 
.diff file is created.
</p>
<p>If a bug also has a .phpt file, then the code and expected output are extracted 
from the test and run. No diff file is created. <strong>Note:</strong> The initial 
implementation of the .phpt file handler is extremely crude. If the phpt file contains 
anything unexpected, the test may fail due to a test parsing error.
