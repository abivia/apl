# Assorted Library Functions

Don't use this. If you do, don't ask for help. You're on your own.

This library first started when PHP 5.0 was brand new. No namespaces, no composer, no lots of
things. Most of the code here shows its age. Swaths of it have been made redundant by frameworks
like Symfony. A bunch of it probably doesn't even compile. Most of the rest is embarrassingly dated.

Some of this code even made it into packages that have wide distribution, although those packages
have evolved to the point where the resemblance has almost entirely disappeared.

Still, there's the occasional bit that's still useful, and where we can't find a handy replacement.
When that happens, we'll bring it closer to the modern world (given that at the time we write this,
the modern world is PHP 8.1 -- if PHP 10.0 is current, run).

An unreliable list of ported modules follows.

* Abivia\Apl\Math - Basic support for 2D and 3D vector and matrix operations.
